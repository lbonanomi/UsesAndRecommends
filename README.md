I'm a pragmatic worker-bee, not an open source purist. These are some of the tools I use daily that I can't give a Github star to:

### These Chrome Plugins
* [Edit This Cookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en): Edit, export, or delete cookie data.  
* [rockstar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rockstar/chjepkekmhealpjipcggnfepkkfeimbd): Bulk export of Okta data  
* [User-Agent Switcher and Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-and-m/bhchdcejhohfmigjafbampogmaanbfkg): Set an arbitrary *User-Agent* header in Chrome. **HINT**: set your User-Agent string to *Jakarta Commons-HttpClient* and watch how many SAML redirects stop.  

### These Jira Management Tools
* [Jira Comment Toolbox](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1214301/comment-toolbox-for-jira): Bulk edit Jira comments by rule, *safely* alter comment authorhip
