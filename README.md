I'm a pragmatic worker-bee, not an open source purist.  
These are some of the tools & platforms that I use daily and that I might not be able to give a Github star to:

### Chrome Plugins:
* [Edit This Cookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en): Edit, export, or delete cookie data.  
* [rockstar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rockstar/chjepkekmhealpjipcggnfepkkfeimbd): Bulk export of Okta data.  
* [User-Agent Switcher and Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-and-m/bhchdcejhohfmigjafbampogmaanbfkg): Set an arbitrary *User-Agent* header in Chrome. **HINT**: set your User-Agent string to *Jakarta Commons-HttpClient* and watch how many SAML redirects stop.  

### Jira Management Tools:
* [Jira Comment Toolbox](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1214301/comment-toolbox-for-jira): Bulk edit Jira comments by rule, *safely* alter comment authorship.  
* [ScriptRunner](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/6820/scriptrunner-for-jira): For everything-else.  
* [User Management for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1215285/user-management-for-jira): Bulk surveillance and management of Jira users.  

### Platforms:
* [Okta](https://www.okta.com/): I love Okta's OIDC apps with AWS Application Load Balancers for adding conditional security to hosted apps.    
* [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date/): If I had 3 wishes granted they would be world peace, a _realy_ first-class BLT sandwhich, and an API to test if a Windows version was in-support; I get one of these.
